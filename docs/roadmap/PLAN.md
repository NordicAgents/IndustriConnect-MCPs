Here you go, a **simple roadmap**, because apparently you enjoy industrial pain but want it nicely structured.

## Phase 1 – “PLC Core Pack” 

**Goal:** Cover the most common PLC / factory stuff.

Add MCPs for:

1. **Siemens S7 (S7comm)**
2. **EtherNet/IP (Rockwell / Allen-Bradley)**
3. **PROFINET** *(even if you start with diagnostics / discovery only)*

## Phase 2 – “Motion & Legacy” 

**Goal:** Add what shows up in real plants next: motion control + old stuff.

Add MCPs for:

1. **EtherCAT**
2. **PROFIBUS** (likely via gateway / adapter)



## Phase 3 – “SCADA & Buildings” 

**Goal:** Go beyond pure factory into infrastructure / buildings.

Add MCPs for:

1. **DNP3** or **IEC 60870-5-104** (pick based on your user base)
2. **BACnet/IP**



## Phase 4 – Vendor Candy (Optional, ongoing)

**Goal:** Add specific vendor protocols when needed.

Candidates:

* Mitsubishi **MELSEC (MC protocol)**
* Omron **FINS**
* Beckhoff **ADS**
